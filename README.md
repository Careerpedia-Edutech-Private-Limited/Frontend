# Frontend Recuiter Dashboard(Building a Dashboard Page with React JS)
In this project, I developed a dashboard page using React JS. The dashboard includes three key components: a sidebar , a navbar and a recruiter list.
I created a dedicated component called Sidebar.js.
Within this component, I defined an array of sidebar options. Each option represents a different section or functionality.
The map method allowed me to iterate through this array and generate corresponding sidebar items
I applied CSS styles to the sidebar to enhance its appearance.

When the user clicks the “Recruiter” option in the sidebar, the application detects this interaction.
The sidebar likely includes a routing mechanism to capture the click event.
Created Another component, RecruiterList.js, handles the recruiter information.
Using the map method, I iterated through an array of recruiters and displayed their names and relevant details.
Each recruiter is uniquely identified using a key attribute, ensuring efficient updates and rendering.

I styled the components using CSS 
Certainly! In the “Recruiter List” page, I designed a dynamic navigation bar (navbar) with an initial heading of “Careerpedia.”

By utilizing React props, I made the heading customizable. Now, when users interact with the page, the heading dynamically updates based on the context. This approach enhances reusability and allows for a more personalized user experience.
